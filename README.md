# Quiz Application
This C#.NET application is made to answer questions, that maybe your friends made for you.
Made with the [MVVM-concept](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel) in mind.

Please note: This project is fully documented in English (in Github), though the code itself contains German keywords.
This will be changed in a later point in time to English only. 

Currently developed by [@getraid](https://github.com/getraid).
Maybe [@feeyz](https://github.com/Feeyz) will contribute something in the future here.
If any issues arrise, just tag them at [issues](https://github.com/getraid/QuizApplication/issues) and we'll get to it.
